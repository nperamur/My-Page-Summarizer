Summarize webpages with ease. Powered by Google Gemini.

My Page Summarizer is a browser extension that lets you quickly generate summaries of webpages using the Google Gemini model.

How to use:
1. To get started, sign in with your Google account.
2. Once signed in, go to the webpage you want to summarize, click the My Page Summarizer extension button, and the popup will display a full summary of the page.
3. You can also select specific text on the webpage, right-click, and choose "Summarize Text" to get a summary of just that selection.
4. After the summary loads, you can ask follow-up questions about anything you want to know more about.

For a smoother experience without shared usage limits, it is highly recommended that you input your own Google Gemini API key in the settings menu.
